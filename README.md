# WatchKit Hack Night

This repo holds the demo for the WatchKit Hack Night (3/30/2015).

## Thymer

Ever known for our love of puns, Thymer is a simple timer application. The timer is a good chance to 
show off multiple facets of WatchKit:

- A ***Glance*** shows us how much time remaining until it goes off.
- A ***Notification*** alerts the wearer to the event.
- For the regular interface, we could present a series of shortcut buttons for five- and ten-minute timers.
